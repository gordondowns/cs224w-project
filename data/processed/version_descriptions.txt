v1
    1328 pairs of structures and spectra
    asymmetric unit only
    edges between every pair of nodes
    atoms sharing a site each get their own nodes
    randomly pair Raman spectra with crystal structures
    include high-T and high-P crystal structures
    the 61 minerals for which we have at least 10 spectra and 10 structures (except diamond)
    feature vectors x are [atomic_number,atomic_weight,electronegativity,occ,Biso]
